This is a monthly "newsletter", containing a list of what I enjoyed the most

or even a painting.

**What I am watching**

* Rose Island (2020)

{{< youtube id="qS2NtbEoIc8" >}}

  - [imdb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10287954/)
  - [netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/81116948)

Very light, incredibly funny and inspiring comedy from Italy. The story focuses
on one engineer who (like many of us) have issues with some laws. Instead of
trying to fight the system, he decides to escape and build his own little world
11 kilometres off the coast of the province of Rimini, Italy.


**What I am reading**

* [100 Tips for a Better Life](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7hFeMWC6Y5eaSixbD/100-tips-for-a-better-life)

PURE GOLD

* [Notes on technology in the 2020s](https://elidourado.com/blog/notes-on-technology-2020s/)

"In this post, my aim is not to predict an end or non-end to stagnation.
Rather, it is to think through the particulars of how technology could evolve
over the next decade. Then we can assess separately whether we should consider
it the Roaring 20s or the Boring 20s."

* [A No-Nonsense Guide to Early Retirement](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ttXGrquvXgouawHEq/a-no-nonsense-guide-to-early-retirement)

This is overall a great read, but I especially enjoyed the "Negotiating"
chapter.

"As to basic strategy:  try not to tell potential employers your current salary
or salary expectations, as they'll mostly use this information to low-ball you
when applicable.  You've got nothing to gain by giving up this information, and
the person on the other end of the conversation is aware of this -- it's simply
their job to try asking anyway."

* [How do I become a millionaire? by Ted Flame](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-become-a-millionaire-1/answer/Ted-Flame-1)

"The Rich Slowly approach is faulty because it takes a lifetime of work, it's
dependent on getting lucky with your investments, and even if you do get rich,
you'll be too old to enjoy it."
