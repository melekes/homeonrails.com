Here are my top 5:

- [The Death of Ivan Ilych by Leo Tolstoy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18386.The_Death_of_Ivan_Ilych)

  "Hailed as one of the world's supreme masterpieces on the subject of death
  and dying, The Death of Ivan Ilyich is the story of a worldly careerist, a
  high court judge who has never given the inevitability of his dying so much
  as a passing thought. But one day, death announces itself to him, and to his
  shocked surprise, he is brought face to face with his own mortality"

  This book creates a great sense of presence. You feel pain, agony, hatred,
  anger. But all of this vanishes in the end, leaving only peace.

  **Highly recommend**.

  I've been lucky to visit Leo's home - [Yasnaya
  Polyana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasnaya_Polyana) last year. Saw the
  house he was born in, his garden and ... even his grave. Loved the forest and
  apple trees. Small fact: there are so many apple trees, every year the museum
  staff has to look for volunteers to help them gather the crop.

- [How to Avoid a Climate Disaster: The Solutions We Have and the Breakthroughs We Need by Bill Gates](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52275335-how-to-avoid-a-climate-disaster)

  "In this urgent, authoritative book, Bill Gates sets out a wide-ranging,
  practical - and accessible - plan for how the world can get to zero
  greenhouse gas emissions in time to avoid a climate catastrophe."

  This is a complex topic and Bill does a great job of structuring the
  available data and paths to move forward.

  Unfortunately there's little you can do on the individual level. Related

- [Greenlights by Matthew McConaughey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52838315-greenlights)

  "From the Academy Award®–winning actor, an unconventional memoir filled with
  raucous stories, outlaw wisdom, and lessons learned the hard way about living
  with greater satisfaction"

  My suggestion is to listen to the audiobook. Matthew has a really nice voice.

- [Wanting: The Power of Mimetic Desire in Everyday Life by Luke Burgis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54860444-wanting)

  "A groundbreaking exploration of why we want what we want, and a toolkit for
  freeing ourselves from chasing unfulfilling desires."

  While I agree that this book has some issues (e.g. Elizabeth Holmes; see
  [reviews](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4124344757?book_show_action=true)),
  I still think it's a good intro into the mimetic theory.

- [Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt by Michael Lewis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24724602-flash-boys)

  "In Michael Lewis's game-changing bestseller, a small group of Wall Street
  iconoclasts realize that the U.S. stock market has been rigged for the
  benefit of insiders. They band together—some of them walking away from
  seven-figure salaries—to investigate, expose, and reform the insidious new
  ways that Wall Street generates profits. If you have any contact with the
  market, even a retirement account, this story is happening to you."

  Felt sorry when the FBI has arrested Sergey Aleynikov. Not because he was a
  software developer like me, but rather the accusations, which seem absurd (so
  when J.P. Morgan is doing HFT it is okay, but when one of the employees quits
  and creates his own company to do the same - it's bad).

Books that didn't make it into top 5, but still worth mentioning:

1. [Дневник Реалиста by Илья
   Волочков](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57486598). I'd recommend it if
   you're in your early twenties.
