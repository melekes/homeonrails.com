This is a ~~monthly~~ "newsletter", containing a list of what I enjoyed the most
last month. Whether it was a full length movie, short film, music album, book
or even a painting.

_I know it's been a long time, but this year is absolutely nuts. I'm going to
write a separate post with my thoughts._

**What I am watching**

* The Origin and Rise of MrBeast

{{< youtube id="_Qq6sCvz4Z0" >}}

"Jimmy Donaldson, aka MrBeast, became obsessed with YouTube at a young age. From
his early days making gaming videos to the massively viral Squid Game video,
Jimmy has built a viral video empire based on the joy he gets from helping
others. In this documentary "Beyond the Spotlight: Mr. Beast" you will hear his
story straight from him and his closest friends and family."

* How The U.S. Ruined Bread

{{< youtube id="FovIyqov1uA" >}}

"I wanted to know why the bread in Europe tastes so much better than the bread
in America, so I went to Paris to find out."

* A day in my life | Lex Fridman

{{< youtube id="0m3hGZvD-0s" >}}

I've become a huge fan of Lex's podcast last year. The man is a productivity
monster. For anyone curious how he does all his work, this video is a perfect
glimpse in his life.

**What I am reading**

* Articles

  - [«We Will See the Return of Capital Investment on a Massive Scale»](https://themarket.ch/interview/russell-napier-the-world-will-experience-a-capex-boom-ld.7606)

    The author predicts the inflation trend is going to continue for at least
    15-20 years. This is also why I'm bullish on stocks & estate and bearish on
    bonds & cash long term.

* Books

  - [The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/767171.The_Rise_and_Fall_of_the_Third_Reich) 5/5

    Monumental book. Highly recommend. There were so many times when Hitler
    could've been stopped :( Sometimes it was his ability to read people, but
    other times it was indecisiveness of European politics plus wrong choices
    of USSR party leaders. Hope the world has learned something since then.

  - [The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2429135.The_Girl_with_the_Dragon_Tattoo) 5/5

    Very light reading for any evening.

  - [Open](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6480781-open) 4/5

    I'm not a fan of big tennis, but the story of Andre Agassi, as with many top
    talents, is an unusual one and was a good read. The most surprising part
    was probably that he hates tennis, but cannot not play it because of his
    character.

  - [Непослушное дитя биосферы](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6377289) 5/5

    Can recommend if you're interested in human ethology.

  - [Дорога к свободе. Беседы с Кахой Бендукидзе](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29428940) 5/5

    Long, but a worthwhile book. Explains a lot what has happened in Georgia
    and the guest's opinion on Russia.

So long
