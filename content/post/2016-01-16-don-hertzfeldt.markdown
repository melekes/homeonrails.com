Personally, I like his original style, the fact that he is not afraid to use
classical music and mix real and painted scenes.

## Bill's story (Trilogy)

This is a story about Bill, who has some troubles with his memory.

Author explores some existentialism and philosophy topics and uses a lot of
dark humor while showing us a life of the main character.
