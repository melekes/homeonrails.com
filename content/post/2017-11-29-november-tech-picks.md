* [Take It to the Limit: Considerations for Building Reliable Systems](http://bravenewgeek.com/take-it-to-the-limit-considerations-for-building-reliable-systems/)
  Read it if you want to know why it's better to be explicit and set limits like queue max size, max msg size, etc. upfront.

* [In search of a simple consensus algorithm](http://rystsov.info/2017/02/15/simple-consensus.html)
  Critique of Raft and introduction to leaderless consensus algorithms plus some benchmarks and analysis.

* [Anatomy of a Program in Memory](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog/post/anatomy-of-a-program-in-memory/)
  Really nice pictures. Feel free to skip if you read at least one OS book.

* [Не число](https://blog.not-a-kernel-guy.com/2017/10/08/nan/)
  "Числа с плавающей запятой обманчиво привычны и из-за этого гораздо более коварны, чем кажется."

* [PRACTICAL PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY](https://hackaday.com/2017/10/18/practical-public-key-cryptography/)
  Very good guide on gpg.

### Go

* [REPRODUCING GO BINARIES BYTE-BY-BYTE](https://blog.filippo.io/reproducing-go-binaries-byte-by-byte/)
  Reproducable builds are very important. As an example, recent [Bitcoin Gold case](https://bitcoingold.org/critical-warning-nov-26/).

### Blockchain

* BIP001: "Unlimited Edition". Vlad Zamfir

{{< youtube id="u6VSPD5TrP4" >}}

Nice talk about cryptoeconomics questions.

* [Quantifying Decentralization](https://news.earn.com/quantifying-decentralization-e39db233c28e)
  "We must be able to measure blockchain decentralization before we can improve
  it." But this might be an interesting read for non-blockchain folks.
