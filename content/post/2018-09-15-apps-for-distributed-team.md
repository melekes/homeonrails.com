Thought I would share applications that we've been using at Tendermint and/or I
can recommend for any folks distributed around the world.

### 1) Comms

Here, [Slack](https://slack.com/) is the King.

**Slack plugins**

- [Donut](https://www.donut.com/) reminds you to stay in touch with your
  colleagues by pinging you on Slack.

**Video conferencing**

[Zoom](https://zoom.us/). There are others obviously, but Zoom usually performs
better, especially when the Internet connection is unstable. It is not working
well on ze linuxs.

**Misc.**

- [Sketchboard](https://sketchboard.io/) allows to draw diagrams and sketches

**Looks promising**

- [Front](https://frontapp.com/) shared inbox for teams

### 2) Timezones pain killers

- [Timezone](https://timezone.io/) gives you a nice dashboard with all employees
categorized by city. [Demo](https://timezone.io/team/buffer).
- [worldtimebuddy](https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/)

### 3) Project management

This category is tough. When it comes to planning, I personally like to keep
things simple. [Trello](https://trello.com/home) or [Github Project
Board](https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/) provide a good
enough board with columns and cards. That's it.

If you need more heavy stuff, [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)
seems to be the most popular choice.

[Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) should be considered too. Beside project
organization, it has team organization, status updates and document storage.
Now, team org can be a spreadsheet in Google Docs, where it along with other
docs will be stored. The final choice is up to you of course.

### 4) Expenses

- [Expensify](https://use.expensify.com/)
