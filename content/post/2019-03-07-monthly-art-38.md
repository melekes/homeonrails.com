This is a monthly "newsletter", containing a list of what I enjoyed the most
last month. Whether it was a full length movie, short film, music album, book
or even a painting.

**What I am watching**

* Wild Wild Country (2018)

{{< youtube id="hBLS_OM6Puk" >}}

I had mixed feelings about this one. Love, joy, meditation is intertwined with
obsession, distrust, and betrayal. It looks like people had a great time in the
70s, but when the thing got out of control, the government intervened and shut
it down effectively. The amazing thing is that the teachings of Osho is still
there and there are many followers. Even in some small cities in Russia!

* Conan O'Brien Delivers Dartmouth's Commencement Address

{{< youtube id="ELC_e2QBQMk" >}}

I thought commencement speeches are all about sharing profound life lessons.
But Conan not only does this, but he also cracks jokes and tells funny stories.
Definitely something new!
