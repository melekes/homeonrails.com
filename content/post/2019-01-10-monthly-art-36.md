This is a monthly "newsletter", containing a list of what I enjoyed the most
last month. Whether it was a full length movie, short film, music album, book
or even a painting.

**What I am watching**

* Jiro Dreams of Sushi (2011)

Perfection raised to a degree of religion, true craftsmanship. I've learned so
much from this movie. First, pay attention to details (e.g., the way Jiro
varies sushi size depending on the size of person's mouth). Second, never stop
learning and experimenting. And lastly, be passioned about what you do.

* My PVC Instrument, DRS Talent Show (Original) (2010)

Discovered this through YouTube suggestions. Wow

* Yuval Noah Harari on Drugs & the "Meaning" of Life (2017)

"Instead of drugs, try boredom. It is hard to find meaning as you broad your horizons."

* Arnold Schwarzenegger (2018)

Nothing special here I guess, but if you think about the story of Arnold Schwarzenegger, it's impressive what the man has done.

**What I am reading**

* [No Matter What You Work For Yourself](https://medium.com/the-mission/no-matter-what-you-work-for-yourself-67e7a2fa038b)

"The only person you really work for is you."

"When you sell yourself to someone for regular hours and a paycheck, they want
to exploit what you already know to grow profits. They don't care about you
getting better."

Although there are companies (especially in the IT sector), that do care about
your career path, in most cases the responsibility is still yours.
