This is a monthly "newsletter", containing a list of what I enjoyed the most

or even a painting.

**What I am watching**

* Cinema Paradiso (1988)

{{< youtube id="w_pmmJo5ho8" >}}

The plot itself is straightforward - successful director returns home after ~
30 years and remembers his childhood. But the stories themselves and the
atmosphere make you feel. A masterpiece directed by Giuseppe Tornatore.

* The silent drama of photography

Sebastio Salgado tells a story of his life and how he's changing a world. Very
powerful video. I would encourage you to read some of [his
books](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/796690.Sebasti_o_Salgado) or watch
[the "The Salt of the Earth"
documentary](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3674140/) directed by his son,
Juliano Ribeiro Salgado.

**What I am reading**

* [Google selfish ledger is an unsettling vision of silicon valley social engineering](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/17/17344250/google-x-selfish-ledger-video-data-privacy)

This internal video from 2016 shows a Google concept for how total data
collection could reshape society.

So far I've met two kinds of people. Ones who are horrified of the future where
AI guides you in everyday decisions. Others are like "Oh, this AI will just
tell me what pasta to order.".

Maybe for most people, the truth is somewhere in the middle. You still decide
who to date, what to wear to the prom, but you are fine if AI orders food for
you.

* [Escapism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escapism)

"Escapism is the avoidance of unpleasant, boring, arduous, scary, or banal
aspects of daily life.[2] It can also be used as a term to define the actions
people take to help relieve persistent feelings of depression or general
sadness."
