This is a monthly "newsletter", containing a list of what I enjoyed the most
last month. Whether it was a full length movie, short film, music album, book
or even a painting.

**What I am watching**

* Maniac (2018)

{{< youtube id="L6cDDmk-O5A" >}}

Another brilliant tv mini-series, produced by Netflix, where in the near future
AI is trying to cure schizophrenic people by messing with their dreams. Sort of
the Inception (2010), but with more diverse scenes.

I like how Cary Joji Fukunaga experiments with camera.

Hands off to the Dan Romer for the musical accompaniment - [Maniac (Music from the Netflix Limited Series) by Dan Romer](https://itunes.apple.com/ru/album/maniac-music-from-the-netflix-limited-series/1436990509?l=en).

* The "End of History" Illusion - Bence Nanay

{{< youtube id="kfDvdYj0_fA" >}}

The problem I am currently facing is where I am struggling to make a choice
because there are too many options. For example, what cup to buy - green or
blue or red. But some options won't matter that much in 10 years or even 1
year.
