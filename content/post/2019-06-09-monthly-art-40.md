This is a monthly "newsletter", containing a list of what I enjoyed the most

or even a painting.

**What I am watching**

* One Strange Rock (2018)

{{< youtube id="XrC4vDcWmxk" >}}

Found this in one of the Tim Ferris ["5-Bullet
Friday"](https://go.tim.blog/5-bullet-friday-1/) emails, as with many other
things. Aside from the stunningly beautiful pictures of the Earth, these series
show how connected the life is. And that you should appreciate you're now
living on this planet as a result on the long chain of events starting from the
Big Bang (\*).

**What I am reading**

* [What You Can't Say](http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html)

"It seems to be a constant throughout history: In every period, people believed
things that were just ridiculous, and believed them so strongly that you would
have gotten in terrible trouble for saying otherwise."

* [Keep Your Identity Small](http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html)

Another gem written by Paul Graham.

* [Status as a Service (StaaS)](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service)

"People are status-seeking monkeys". Beware, this is a very long read.
