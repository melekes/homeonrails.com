Here are my top 4 (why 4? there were other good books, but the books below are simply amazing):

- [The Way to Love by Anthony de Mello](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/138878.The_Way_to_Love)

  I love deprogramming. I loved this book.

- [Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends on It by Kamal Ravikant](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15704926-love-yourself-like-your-life-depends-on-it)

  I was a little bit sceptical at first, but since the book is only 68 pages, I
  decided to give it a go. The message is very clear, yet powerful for ones at
  the bottom. I definitely felt Kamal's pain and happy that he came through.
  Been following him ever since (he has a podcast and a few other books).

- [Hyperion Cantos by Dan Simmons](https://www.goodreads.com/series/40461)

  Recalling how much I loved the first book back in 2018, I've decided to
  finish the whole series. Totally worth it.

- [Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling](https://www.goodreads.com/series/45175)

  Before this, I've only watched Harry Potter movies, but haven't read the
  actual series. My intention was to read something accessible in English
  (note: I still find some fiction hard to read). It was a good match. The
  books are very easy to read. I also found them incredibly enjoyable.
  Sometimes it was almost impossible to stop reading. I often felt a sense of
  presence, which is a rare feeling!

You can find all the other books as well as some statistics on
