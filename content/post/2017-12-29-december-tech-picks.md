**Articles**

* [Never edit a method, always rewrite it](https://dave.cheney.net/2017/11/30/never-edit-a-method-always-rewrite-it)
  May seem too radical, but the idea is very interesting and compelling...
  Worth trying anyway.

* [Simplistic programming is underrated](https://lemire.me/blog/2017/12/06/simplistic-programming-is-underrated/)
  "I like the concept of “simplistic programming” by which I mean “programming
  that is so simple that people will criticize you for it”. At first, that
  sounds strange… can we really get criticized for being “too simple”? Of
  course, we do."

* [Why Firing Brilliant Assholes Is Required to Build a Great Engineering Culture](http://firstround.com/review/why-firing-brilliant-assholes-is-required-to-build-a-great-engineering-culture/)
  "Some founders think that you hire a bunch of great engineers, put them in a
  room and awesome stuff is just going to come out. Unfortunately, that’s just
  not the case. You need to manage and cultivate your culture if you’re going
  to build great products — and you can do this through communication."

* [Myths about /dev/urandom](https://www.2uo.de/myths-about-urandom/)
  tldr: Just use /dev/urandom!

* [Formal Verification: The Gap Between Perfect Code and Reality](https://raywang.tech/2017/12/20/Formal-Verification:-The-Gap-between-Perfect-Code-and-Reality/)
  State of the formal verification field. tldr: still hard to write proofs.

**Papers**

* [The Case for Learned Index Structures](https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/papers/1712.01208v1/)
  This is huge! I have never seen AI applied to such a low level before.

**На русском**

* [Рабочая этика](https://vorushin.github.io/blog/work-ethic)
  Про культурные различия с западными компаниями.
