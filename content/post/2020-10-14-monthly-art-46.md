**What I am watching**

* The Social Dilemma (2020)

This got me scared. Tech giants are the world's wealthiest companies. They
employ the recommendation algorithms, which threaten democracy by feeding
different news to different people (increasing polarization). There's also a
loneliness aspect amongst teenagers. These are challenging problems, but they
need to be solved.

* (RU) The Russian job (2017)

АвтоВАЗ пригласил шведа Бу Андерссона. Тот уволил кучу ничего не делавших людей
и наладил процессы. Уволенные люди взбунтовались и организовали митинги.
АвтоВАЗ уволил шведа. Конец :)

* Uncle Roger DISGUSTED by this Egg Fried Rice Video (BBC Food)

**What I am reading**

* [Your Lifestyle Has Already Been Designed](https://www.raptitude.com/2010/07/your-lifestyle-has-already-been-designed/)

"The ultimate tool for corporations to sustain a culture of this sort is to
develop the 40-hour workweek as the normal lifestyle. Under these working
conditions people have to build a life in the evenings and on weekends. This
arrangement makes us naturally more inclined to spend heavily on entertainment
and conveniences because our free time is so scarce."

* [68 Bits of Unsolicited Advice](https://kk.org/thetechnium/68-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/)

"It’s my birthday. I’m 68. I feel like pulling up a rocking chair and
dispensing advice to the young ‘uns. Here are 68 pithy bits of unsolicited
advice which I offer as my birthday present to all of you"

* [Signaling as a Service](https://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/)

a) Most of our everyday actions can be traced back to some form of signaling or status seeking
b) Our brains deliberately hide this fact from us and others (self deception)
