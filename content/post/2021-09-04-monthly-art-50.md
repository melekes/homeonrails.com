This is a ~~monthly~~ "newsletter", containing a list of what I enjoyed the most
last month. Whether it was a full length movie, short film, music album, book
or even a painting.

**What I am watching**

* Fahrenheit 9/11 (2004)

{{< youtube id="yg-be2r7ouc" >}}

  - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_9/11)
  - [imdb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361596/)

"Michael Moore's view on what happened to the United States after September 11
and how the Bush Administration allegedly used the tragic event to push forward
its agenda for unjust wars in Afghanistan and Iraq"

This documentary has showed me two things: 1) sometimes a president is just a
public face and does not really decide anything 2) mass manipulation through
media is at its all time high.

**What I am reading**

* [Clicker Training deaf cats](http://deafdarlings.dk/en/clicker-training-deaf-cats/)

A month ago I got myself a Turkish angora kitten with beautiful blue eyes.
Unfortunately, blue eyes often come with a cost (of being deaf) when it comes
to cats. So, I am training Zemfira (Ze for short) using a Russian sign language
and a flashlight.
