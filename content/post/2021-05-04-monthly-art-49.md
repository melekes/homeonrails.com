This is a ~~monthly~~ "newsletter", containing a list of what I enjoyed the most
last month. Whether it was a full length movie, short film, music album, book
or even a painting.

**What I am watching**

* The Painter and the Thief (2020)

{{< youtube id="5Cnh8zpLaKI" >}}

  - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Painter_and_the_Thief)
  - [imdb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11296058/)

Every now and then I feel like I can't be surprised any more. But then comes a
documentary or a book which just blows my mind. This is certainly one of those.
A painter from Oslo meets a thief who stole two of her paintings. Over time
they become close friends helping each other through dark times.

"Through Darkness Comes Light, Through Fear Comes Love and Through Pain Comes
Triumph" Mary Paleologos.

**What I am reading**

* [WallStreetBets is trying something unprecedented in history and the media's not reporting on it at all](https://yudkowsky.medium.com/r-wallstreetbets-is-trying-something-unprecedented-in-history-and-the-medias-not-reporting-it-7ab507e4a038)

A little bit outdated, but still worth reading if you haven't seen it.

* [Coordination, Good and Bad](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/09/11/coordination.html)

"While it is emphatically true that "everyone coordinating with everyone" leads
to much better outcomes than "every man for himself", what that does NOT imply
is that each individual step toward more coordination is necessarily
beneficial. If coordination is improved in an unbalanced way, the results can
easily be harmful."
