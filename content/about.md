Born in Ulyanovsk, Russia on March 25, 1988. Both of my parents were engineers
so I've followed in their footsteps. During the 90s I was cooking for my father
and his colleagues while they were trying to make some money in construction as
there were no other jobs available (remember USSR collapsed in 1991). Later my
father used this knowledge to help me build a house.

After I've graduated from school, I went to the local state technical
university. There I learned a bunch of stuff including how to write code.

5 years later, I got my masters degree and immediately got hired by one of my
professors who was working part-time for a e-commerce startup.

Over the following 5 years I've changed a few companies and grew as an engineer
a lot. Learned Go, Erlang. Looked into internals of some databases, Linux OS,
HTTP proxies, web frameworks and so on.

In the late 2016, I was tired of working on something, which wasn't helping
people much (I won't go into much detail here). That's when I've stumbled upon
a crypto startup called [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/).

8 years have passed and I am still around ðŸ˜„

> Quoting @dystopiabreaker on Twitter: "i am primarily interested in crypto as a technology which can use cryptography and distributed systems to give individuals and communities more autonomy and to make more resilient, secure, verifiable, and interoperable financial rails"

Currently, I work at [Informal Systems](https://informal.systems/) as an Ecosystem Team Lead.
